# Deep-Learning-Fundamentals-Logistic-Regression
The aim of this project is to implement all the machinery, including gradient descent, cost function, and logistic regression, of the various learning algorithms, for a deeper understanding of the fundamentals. Goal is to be able to build a logistic regression model using Python and NumPy, conduct basic exploratory data analysis, and implement gradient descent from scratch.
 
Learning objectives:

Implement Logistic Regression using Python and Numpy.  
Apply Logistic Regression to solve binary classification problems.
